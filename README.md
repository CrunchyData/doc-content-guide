# Content Guide

This content guide is for Crunchy Data employees to use as a general reference for creating technical content (user guides, READMEs, etc.). The repository contains a collection of Markdown files:

- [index.md](.=context/_index.md) is for the homepage
- [01-tldr.md](./01-tldr.md) is intended to highlight the most important points throughout the guide
- [06-writing-technical-content.md](./06-writing-technical-content.md) is a collection of *writing* guidelines that apply to any kind of technical content
- There are specific sections for user guides, READMEs, blog posts, and learn.crunchydata.com (Katacoda) - more may be added later if necessary
