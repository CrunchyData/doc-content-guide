Occasionally, you might want to create a video to accompany written content. Perhaps you want to show how to navigate an application's visual components. Or, maybe you want to emphasize how quick and easy it is to follow the steps for a guide you wrote. Video can be a powerful tool to more strongly convey a message to your intended audience.

## Guidelines

### Video does not replace written content

As mentioned in the previous section on [Writing for Accessibility](../11-writing-for-accessibility/), our content must be accessible to anyone regardless of the methods or tools they might use to do so. If the information is essential or important enough for your audience's needs, aim to get it in writing first. Then, produce a video version if necessary.

Closed captioning or transcripts should be available for all videos. 

### Make it easily digestible 

Just like written content, you don't want users to feel burdened by a lengthy video. It likely won't be able to keep a viewer's attention for too long (no matter how exciting your topic is!). Five to ten minutes will work well. 

If you must have longer videos, consider breaking it up into parts of a series.

### Include narration

One of the reasons video can be impactful is that it can add more of the "human" element to your message. Narration and the addition of your voice can help users feel a little more connected to you as the author.

When narrating:

* Speak slowly.
* Use plain language.
* If you're narrating anything that is affected by the layout as shown on screen, describe elements in relation to other objects (e.g. "Click the select menu next to the 'Query' label," instead of "Click on the select menu over here."). This helps users follow along without having to pause what they're doing to see where you are in the video.  

### Prepare a script

Think through what you want to show beforehand, and write an outline or script to guide yourself. 

Feel free to introduce yourself. Make sure to let the viewers know what you'll be talking about in the video. To close the video, it's a good idea to encourage viewers to interact with us if they have further questions.

Example:  
Intro: "Hi, this is Cordelia Moreno, and I'm a software engineer at Crunchy Data. In this video I'll be covering..."

End: "Thanks for watching this demo. Feel free to reach out to the team at Crunchy Data for more information, or leave me a question in the comments section."
